Normally numbers preceding the function are the amount of inputs, and numbers after the function are used if the cell has multiple output transistors

DFFS: Data flip flop, created by two muxes in serie which each connect output to input.
DFF-CON: Generate inverted CLK needed for DFFS
DFFTR: Data Flip Flop with tri-state
TR: Buffer with tri-state output
SUM6: part of an adder?
LATCH: Cell that enables output as soon as clock is in right state.

DFF_ALR: DFF with Active low reset, and outputs both inverted and non inverted outputs
DFF_E: Classic rising edge D flip flop with Data and "clock" input. This variant does not need external clock and inverse clock generator.

AOI21: And or invert gate, computes: NOT OR ( AND (A, B), C)
OAI21: Or and invert gate, computes: NOT AND ( OR (A, B), C)

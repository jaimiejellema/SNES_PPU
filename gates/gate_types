ormally numbers preceding the function are the amount of inputs, and numbers after the function are used if the cell has multiple output transistors

DFFS: Data flip flop, created by two muxes in serie which each connect output to input.
DFF-CON: Generate inverted CLK needed for DFFS
DFFTR: Data Flip Flop with tri-state
TR: Tristate
SUM6: part of an adder?

DFF_ALR: DFF with Active low reset, and outputs both inverted and non inverted outputs

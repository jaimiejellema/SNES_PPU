# SNES PPU Reverse Engineering
In this repository I will try to keep my progress in reversing the the Super Nintendo Entertainment System's Picture Processor Unit, which according to the best of my knowledge is the only part of the SNES which has not yet been fully reverse engineered. This repo is trying to answer the call for help in [this](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/how-snes-emulators-got-a-few-pixels-from-complete-perfection/) Ars Technica article.

## Contributors
I did not start this reverse engineer effort, I am building on the work of others, most notably Akari1982, on the bsnes Discord server. The die shots have been made by [John McMaster](https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster). If you want to be added to this list, please let me know.

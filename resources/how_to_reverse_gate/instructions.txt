1) Trace out the poly level wells
2) Trace the poly interconnections
3) Trace out the metal layer, making sure to include power and ground.
4) Draw all the vias
5) Draw all the gates at the well / interconnect boundary
6) Use power and ground from step 3 to determine N-MOS vs P-MOS
7) Simplify connections by using numbers
8) Only the necessary
9) Make truth table / determine functionality
